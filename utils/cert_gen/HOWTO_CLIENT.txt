Generating a basic client SSL certificate for testing purposes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SSL certificates can be generated using the 'openssl' utility. To automate
this task, the 'gen_client_cert.sh' script is provided. This will issue a new
client certificate using the 'CA.pem' as the certification authority.

Note: such certificates are of course not considered trustworthy by common web
browsers and operating systems, they are only suitable for testing.

To generate a client certificate, just run the provided script as follows:
./gen_client_cert.sh <username>

The issued certificate will have the "emailAddress" DN and "commonName" in the form of
username@mail.cz. This will be used as the username by Jetconf server.

The following files will be generated:
username.pem - the client certificate
username.key - the client private key
username_curl.pem - the concateration of previous 2 files. Some utilities, like
CURL, expect the client certificate in this form.
username.pfx - certificate and private key in PKCS#12 format. Required for
importing into web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...).
